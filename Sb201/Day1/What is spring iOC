Q1. What Is Spring IOC? Why is it needed?

IoC container is a framework for implementing automated dependency injection. 
It contains object creation for the longer ways to use and injects dependencies within the class. 
The IoC container constructs an object of the selected class and also injects all the dependency objects 
via a constructor, a property, or a function at execution time and disposes it at a suitable time. 
This approach helps to create and manage objects manually.

Uses ->
Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures 
and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. 
The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.
